Searchlight uses the |hl-Searchlight| group to highlight the current match.
Defaults to |hl-ErrorMsg|. Example of setting to |hl-Incsearch|: >

	highlight link Searchlight Incsearch
<

                                    *searchlight-update* *<Plug>(Searchlight)*
Searchlight's highlighting can be updated via: >

	:1Searchlight
<
                                            *g:searchlight_disable_on_startup*
Setting |g:searchlight_disable_on_startup| to 1 will prevent Searchlight from
activating on startup. Defaults to 0. >

	let g:searchlight_disable_on_startup = 1
<

3. Known Issues                                            *searchlight-issues*

When using any search command like: "*" (|star|), |#|, etc at the beginning of
a match and it is the only match, then searchlight will not trigger.

One solution would be to trigger an update with mappings like so: >

	nnoremap <silent> * *:1Searchlight<cr>
	nnoremap <silent> # #:1Searchlight<cr>
<
However, this goes against the goal of having no mappings. Sad panda
